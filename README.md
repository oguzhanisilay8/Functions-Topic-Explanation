# Functions – Topic Explanation (R)

This repository contains **beginner-level teaching material** that explains  
**functions in R** in a simple and intuitive way, using **bioinformatics-related examples**.

The content is written from a **student perspective** and is designed for those who are
new to both **R programming** and **bioinformatics**.

---

## What This Repository Covers

The material focuses on understanding **what functions are**, **why we use them**, and  
**how they work internally**, step by step.

Topics include:

### 1. What Is a Function?
- Why we need functions
- Reusing code instead of rewriting it
- Input → process → output logic
- Everyday-life analogy (food processor)

### 2. Structure of a Function in R
- Function name
- Parameters (inputs)
- Code block
- `return()` value

### 3. Simple Function Example
- A basic function that multiplies a number by two
- How function arguments work
- How results are returned

### 4. Biological Example: GC Content Calculation
- Writing a GC content function using:
  - `for` loops
  - `if` conditions
  - counters (accumulators)
- Understanding each line of the function
- Applying the function to a DNA sequence

### 5. Bioinformatics Example: Leaf Status Analysis
- Using a function with `if / else`
- Returning categorical biological results
