# Functions – Topic Explanation (R)

This repository contains beginner-level teaching material that explains how functions work in R using simple language and bioinformatics-related examples.

The content is written from a student’s perspective and is designed for learners who are new to both R programming and bioinformatics. The main goal is to make abstract programming concepts easier to understand through clear explanations and practical examples.

## What This Repository Covers

This material focuses on understanding what functions are, why they are used, and how they work internally, step by step.

The following topics are covered:

### 1. What Is a Function?
- Why functions are needed in programming  
- Reusing code instead of rewriting it  
- Understanding the input → process → output logic  
- Everyday-life analogy (food processor example)

### 2. Structure of a Function in R
- Function naming  
- Parameters (inputs)  
- Code block structure  
- The role of `return()` values  

### 3. Simple Function Example
- A basic function that multiplies a number by two  
- How function arguments work  
- How results are returned and stored  

### 4. Biological Example: GC Content Calculation
- Writing a GC content function using:
  - `for` loops  
  - `if` conditions  
  - counters (accumulators)  
- Understanding each line of the function  
- Applying the function to DNA sequences  

### 5. Bioinformatics Example: Leaf Status Analysis
- Using functions with `if / else` logic  
- Returning categorical biological results  
- Interpreting outputs in a biological context

## Educational Philosophy

This project follows a simple and learner-centered teaching approach:

- No advanced or unexplained R functions are used  
- Concepts are introduced gradually and logically  
- Emphasis is placed on understanding how the computer processes instructions  
- Biological meaning is explained alongside programming logic  

The aim is not only to teach syntax, but also to develop problem-solving and analytical thinking skills.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

Artificial intelligence tools were partially used during the development of this material, mainly for:

- Improving explanations and clarity  
- Refining documentation structure  
- Supporting learning, debugging, and idea organization  

All core concepts, examples, implementations, and final validations were performed by the author. The use of AI reflects an effort to integrate modern tools into the learning and content creation process.
